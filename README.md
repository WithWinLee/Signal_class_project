# Signal_class_project
Code had separate in 2 file as Project for done some Denoising and ML(1) for train the model.
First run Project for training Autoencoder model for denoising 240 images were used to train and 60 images were used to test and extract as Noise and denoised dataset for CNN testing.
Run ML for training CNN model to classify xray image into 3 types as COVID19 pneumonia, Other caused pneumonia and Normal chest X-ray images.
After that import noise, denoised and original image dataset that prepared to test to model.
